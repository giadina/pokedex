### Docker

The application can be dockerized also. If you want to run it this way, you will need docker running on your laptop.

2. build the image running `docker build -t pokedex-api .`
3. run the image with `docker run â€“p 8080:8080 xxxx`, where xxx=container_id generated from step 1 or the image tag
(pokedex-api in this case)
4. test the application calling the container ip and port 8080. You can look for the host ip with
`docker exec container_id cat /etc/hosts`.
